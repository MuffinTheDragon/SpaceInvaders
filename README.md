# SpaceInvaders


Game Rules:

  Level 1:
   Kill 40 Enemy Aliens without getting hit before they reach the bottom of the screen and pass your fortifications. 
  
  Level 2:
   Afterwards, kill the UFO by hitting it 100 times without getting hit by its rockets before it reaches the bottom of the screen      
   and passes your fortifications. 

  Bonus Points: 
   You will receive bonus points if you win depending on how many shots you fired (time your shots, don't spam space). 
    
   Bonus Point System: 
   140 Shots Fired or Less: 
   This means every shot you took was a kill and earns you a bonus of 5000 points.
    
   200 Shots Fired or Less:
   Not perfect, but will still earn you a bonus of 3000 points (Most commonly achieved).
    
   250 Shots Fired or Less:
   Shouldn't need to take this many shots in the first place, but, luckily, it still earns you a bonus of 1000 points. 
    
   More than 250 Shots Fired: 
   You'd be lucky if you win the game; no bonus points.

Win Condition: Kill the UFO
